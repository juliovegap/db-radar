DRAC OS is a self-contained GPS waypoint radar firmware for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.1
round display, part of the db-radar project. Load a GPX file over WiFi, step outside, and the radar
shows where each waypoint sits relative to the direction you're facing — no phone, no app, no signal
required once it's loaded.

## What It Does

**The radar** runs entirely on the device, powered by open-source DRAC OS firmware. Waypoints appear as dots on a compass-driven radar that
rotates as you turn (or stays fixed north-up, your choice), with off-screen waypoints clustered
into edge indicators so a hundred-pin GPX file doesn't turn into visual noise. Fix a single
waypoint to get a live distance readout and a buzzer that quickens as you close in. A separate BLE
mode does the same thing for a Bluetooth tag instead of a GPS point — useful as a short-range item
finder.

### Features

- **Compass-driven heading-up navigation** — the radar rotates as you turn; switch to a fixed
  north-up mode in Settings, persisted across reboots (BH-880/BE-881/BN-880 builds only — an LC76G
  build has no compass and runs North-Up automatically, see [GPS Module Options](#gps-module-options))
- **GPS waypoint radar** — five zoom levels from 1km down to a 50m precision mode; your position
  is a red triangle at center, waypoints are yellow dots
- **Off-screen indicators** — waypoints outside the current zoom radius collapse into up to 8 edge
  arrows, one per compass sector, so dozens of distant pins don't clutter the screen
- **Waypoint fix mode** — single out a waypoint for a continuously-updating distance readout and a
  proximity sonar (buzzer tempo speeds up continuously as you approach, not in discrete zones);
  auto-releases if you end up more than 100km away
- **BLE beacon proximity** (50m zoom) — point the radar at a specific Bluetooth tag instead of a
  waypoint; an arc gauge and buzzer tone track signal strength continuously as you get closer
- **GPX file management over WiFi** — upload, browse, and delete `.gpx` files from any browser,
  no companion app or cable needed after initial setup
- **Two WiFi modes** — the device can host its own access point (no router needed) or join your
  home network
- **Over-the-air firmware updates** — flash new firmware from the browser once the device is on
  your network
- **Battery monitoring** — charge-level icon on-screen, colored by threshold
- **Daylight mode** — high-contrast black-on-white theme for outdoor visibility in direct sun
- **Hardware watchdog and crash logging** for field reliability

### In progress

**Quests** — a GPX file tagged as a set of waypoints to find as a group, with progress tracking
and a small collectible badge on completion. Design is substantially resolved and some prep work
has already shipped, but the feature itself isn't built yet — see
[docs/quests_plan.md](docs/quests_plan.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for where it stands.

## GPS Module Options

One firmware image, four supported modules — pick based on whether you want the compass, and
which one you can source:

- **BH-880** (primary, recommended) — GPS + compass (QMC5883L) in one module, enables Heading-Up
  navigation (the radar rotates as you turn). Needs 3.6–5.5V, so it's powered through a boost
  converter (see [Assembly Instructions](docs/assembly.md)).
- **BE-881** — GPS + compass (QMC5883P), same UBX protocol family as the BH-880.
- **LC76G** — GPS only, no compass. Cheaper and simpler to wire (no I2C connection needed), but the
  device is locked to North-Up navigation since there's no heading source to rotate by — the
  Settings screen disables the Heading-Up option automatically rather than offering one that would
  silently do nothing.
- **BN-880** — GPS + compass (HMC5883L), NMEA/PAIR protocol family (same path as LC76G). Fully
  supported in firmware but not yet on the first-boot picker pending further field verification —
  reachable via Settings or serial (`gps module set bn880`).

BH-880, BE-881, and LC76G are the three field-verified options offered on the first-boot picker. The
module type is a one-time choice: the picker appears on first boot, or set it any time via
**Settings > GPS** or serial (`gps module set bh880|lc76g|bn880|be881`, see
[docs/serial_commands.md](docs/serial_commands.md)). Full detail on all four, including the UBX vs.
NMEA protocol handling under the hood: [docs/bh880_module.md](docs/bh880_module.md).

## 3D Enclosure

A custom enclosure designed for this build is available at:

[**Dragon Ball Radar**](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2776400-dragon-ball-radar)

**Print settings**: PLA or PETG, 0.2mm layer height, 20% infill. Mounts the board face-up, with a
cutout for the USB-C port and a recess for the LiPo underneath.

---

## Installation

Three ways to get firmware onto the board — you don't need any toolchain unless you want one.

### Option A — Browser Web Flasher (easiest, no install required)

1. Open the web flasher: **[alvroga.github.io/db-radar/flasher](https://alvroga.github.io/db-radar/flasher/)**
   (Chrome or Edge on desktop — Web Serial required)
2. Plug the board in via a USB-C **data** cable (charge-only cables won't work)
3. Click **Connect & Install**, select the serial port, and choose **Erase device and install** on
   a new board

### Option B — Download + esptool

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alvroga/db-radar/releases/latest)
2. Grab the full merged image (bootloader + partition table + app, one file)
3. Flash it to a blank board:
   ```bash
   pip install esptool
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 write_flash 0x0 <downloaded-file>.bin
   ```

### Option C — Build from source with PlatformIO

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvroga/db-radar.git
cd db-radar
pio run -e db-radar -t upload
```

Already flashed and just want to update? Use the device's own web portal instead — open
`http://<device-ip>/update` and upload the smaller, app-only OTA image from the same release (not
the full image — the portal expects the raw app binary only).

### First Boot

1. Wire the GPS module per the [Assembly Instructions](docs/assembly.md)
2. Display shows the green radar background
3. GPS status reads "Waiting for fix..." until satellite lock (cold start ~30s outdoors)
4. After fix: waypoints appear, compass drives radar rotation

### Loading GPX Waypoints

1. Power on the board — it creates a WiFi access point named `Radar-GPX` (password: `radar123`)
2. Connect your phone or laptop to that network
3. Browse to `http://192.168.4.1`
4. Upload any `.gpx` file — waypoints appear on the radar immediately

Alternatively, switch to STA mode in Settings to join your home network instead; the web portal is
then reachable at the device's IP address, shown on the Settings screen.

Don't have a GPX file yet? Build one — including per-waypoint hint text — with the
**[GPX Generator](https://alvroga.github.io/db-radar/gpx-generator/)**, or export one from any standard
geocaching/GPX tool; the radar reads the `<groundspeak:encoded_hints>` field automatically if present.

### FreeRTOS Task Architecture

| Task | Core | Priority | Loop | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------|------|----------------|
| UI Task | 1 | 5 | 10ms | LVGL rendering, touch/button input, radar draw |
| I2C Task | 0 | 2 | 20ms | Queued I2C device communication (RTC, IO expander) |
| Network Task | 0 | 1 | 200ms | WiFi/BLE scanning |
| System Task | 0 | 1 | 100ms | GPS parsing, compass reads (10Hz), battery, health checks |

The UI task is alone on core 1 so touch and rendering never wait on I2C or radio work; everything
else shares core 0 through queued requests rather than direct calls.

### Rendering

The radar isn't drawn to an offscreen canvas and copied — it paints directly into LVGL's draw
context from a draw-event callback, so there's no intermediate buffer or frame copy. The physical
90° enclosure rotation is handled by a tiled transpose in the display flush callback (not LVGL's
software rotation), writing straight into the panel's back framebuffer. Frame time is roughly 85ms
at 240MHz (about 10-12 fps) — plenty for a radar display where the picture only needs to update as
fast as you can walk or turn.

### Driver Table

## Build Metrics

Measured directly from a clean build:

- **RAM**: 51.4% (168,352 / 327,680 bytes)
- **Flash**: 41.0% (1,718,851 / 4,194,304 bytes — one OTA app partition; the board's flash is 16MB
  total, split across two OTA slots plus onboard storage)
- **PSRAM**: 8MB octal PSRAM handles the LVGL display buffers and the full-device waypoint index;
  most of it stays free for application use
