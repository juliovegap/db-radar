## Architecture Overview

WiFi operates in three distinct modes, each with a different entry point:

| Mode | Entry | Radar Active | Web Server |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AP Standalone Boot** | Settings → reboot | No | Yes (AP SSID `Radar-GPX`) |
| **STA Standalone Boot** | Settings → reboot | No | Yes (device IP on home network) |
| **In-Session (STA)** | Settings toggle, no reboot | Yes | Yes (IP shown in WiFi tab) |

**Mutual exclusion**: AP and STA modes cannot run simultaneously. The WiFi and BLE radio stacks are also mutually exclusive — NimBLE is only initialised in radar mode (no WiFi active).

---

## Boot Modes

Two NVS flags in the `radar` namespace control boot behavior:

```
wifi_ap_en   (u8, bool) — boot into Access Point mode
wifi_sta_en  (u8, bool) — boot into WiFi STA mode and auto-connect
```

On boot, `settings_manager::loadSettings()` reads these flags. If either is set, the corresponding WiFi mode is started before the UI transitions out of the loading screen.

**Important**: After any firmware update (USB or OTA) the flags are cleared automatically — the device always boots to radar mode on first post-flash boot. See [Boot Mode Safety](#boot-mode-safety).

---

## WiFi AP Mode (Standalone)

The device creates its own WiFi access point. No router required.

**Default credentials:**
- SSID: `Radar-GPX`
- Password: `radar123`

These are hardcoded in `src/gpx/gpx_server.cpp`:
```cpp
static const char* AP_SSID     = "Radar-GPX";
static const char* AP_PASSWORD = "radar123";
```

**Enabling AP boot mode:**
1. Go to Settings → WiFi → Access Point section
2. Toggle "AP Boot Mode" on
3. Confirm reboot when prompted
4. On reboot, device creates the AP, starts web server, and shows the IP on screen

**Web portal URL:** `http://192.168.4.1` (default ESP32 AP IP)

**Hardware path:**
```
main.cpp:setup() → settings.wifi_ap_enabled == true
  → wifi_manager::init()
  → gpx_server::start()   (creates AP + HTTP server)
  → UI: LOAD_AP_SCREEN
```

---

## WiFi STA Mode (Standalone)

The device connects to a saved WiFi network on boot without showing the radar screen. Useful for firmware updates or bulk GPX management sessions.

**Enabling STA boot mode:**
1. Go to Settings → WiFi → connect to a network (credentials saved to NVS)
2. Toggle "STA Boot Mode" on
3. Confirm reboot when prompted
4. On reboot, device auto-connects and shows the web portal URL

**Web portal URL:** displayed on the STA boot screen (varies by network DHCP)

**Hardware path:**
```
main.cpp:setup() → settings.wifi_sta_boot == true
  → wifi_manager::init()
  → wifi_manager::autoConnect()   (uses saved NVS credentials)
  → UI: LOAD_WIFI_SCREEN
```

---

## Settings-Based WiFi (In-Session)

Standard WiFi — radar stays active, WiFi runs alongside it. Used for GPX uploads during a navigation session without rebooting.

**Enabling:**
1. Settings → WiFi tab → toggle WiFi on
2. Scan networks, select SSID, enter password
3. Web portal URL appears in the WiFi tab once connected

**Differences from standalone modes:**
- Radar screen stays visible
- BLE beacon scanning is disabled while WiFi is active
- WiFi auto-starts on boot only if `wifi_enabled` was left on (session-only flag, not persisted across reboots)

---

## GPX Web Portal

HTTP server (`esp_http_server`) with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | GPX upload page (dark theme, drag-and-drop) |
| `/upload` | POST | Upload a `.gpx` file (`?filename=` query param, raw body) |
| `/list` | GET | JSON array of `{file, name}` — `name` is the cache's `<groundspeak:name>` (or its `<name>` GC code as fallback), pulled from the file so the upload page can show something more useful than the filename |
| `/download/gpx/<file>` | GET | Download a specific GPX file |
| `/delete/<file>` | DELETE | Delete a GPX file |
| `/storage` | GET | JSON `{total, free, used, percent}` for the FFat partition — drives the upload page's storage gauge |
| `/dev-status` | GET | JSON `{dev_mode}` — upload page uses this to hide the "System Logs" nav link when dev mode is off |
| `/logs` | GET | System log viewer — 404 unless `dev_mode` is on. "Select all" + "Delete Selected" bulk-delete via looped calls to `/delete/logs/<file>` |
| `/logs-list` | GET | JSON array of `{name, size}` for files in `/logs/` — 404 unless `dev_mode` is on |
| `/delete/logs/<file>` | DELETE | Delete a log/CSV file — 404 unless `dev_mode` is on |
| `/update` | GET | OTA firmware update page |
| `/update` | POST | Flash new firmware binary |

**File storage:** GPX files live on the FFat flash partition at `/ffat/gpx` (moved off SD 2026-08-06,
see ADR-0024 and ROADMAP.md's "GPX Storage: Move from SD to FFat"). All `.gpx` files in this folder
are auto-loaded on boot. The one-time SD→FFat migration that originally lived in `gpx_loader::init()`
has been **removed** (2026-08-07) — it couldn't distinguish "never migrated" from "user deliberately
deleted everything," so a delete-all could silently resurrect old files from SD on the next boot.
FFat is now the sole source of truth for GPX files; no migration path exists in either direction. Dev-only logging
(`system_logger`, `field_log`, `tilt_bench`) stays on the physical SD card at `/sdcard/logs`, gated
behind `dev_mode` as noted above.

**Implementation:** `src/gpx/gpx_server.cpp`

---

## OTA Firmware Update

Accessible at `/update`. The device writes the uploaded `.bin` directly to the inactive OTA partition.

**Partition layout** (`partitions/partitions_ota.csv`, grown 2026-08-06 from an original 2MB/11.7MB
split — see ADR-0024):
```
nvs       0x9000    16KB
otadata   0xE000     8KB
ota_0     0x10000    4MB   ← active or standby
ota_1     0x410000   4MB   ← active or standby
ffat      0x810000  ~7.69MB
coredump  0xFC0000  256KB
```

**Upload flow:**
1. Browse to `/update`
2. Select `.bin` file (built by `pio run`)
3. Click "Flash firmware" — progress bar shows upload %
4. On success, page replaces itself with a reboot notice (no retry possible)
5. Device calls `prepareForOTAReboot()`, sets boot partition, restarts

**One-shot guard:** `static bool ota_already_triggered` resets only on reboot. A stale browser tab or retry cannot re-flash the device in the same session.

**Rollback safety:** `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE=y` is set in `sdkconfig.defaults`. New firmware must call `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` within the boot window or the bootloader reverts to the previous partition. This call is made in `main.cpp` after the radar screen transition is queued.

## NVS Storage

Two namespaces are used:

| Namespace | Key | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| `radar` | `wifi_ap_en` | u8 bool | AP standalone boot enabled |
| `radar` | `wifi_sta_en` | u8 bool | STA standalone boot enabled |
| `radar` | `fw_stamp` | u32 | Per-build Unix timestamp (boot mode guard) |
| `wifi` | `ssid` | str | Saved network SSID |
| `wifi` | `password` | str | Saved network password |

The `wifi` namespace is intentionally separate from `radar` so that OTA updates and stamp resets never clear credentials.

**API:**
```cpp
settings_manager::saveWiFiAPEnabled(bool);   // radar namespace
settings_manager::saveWiFiSTABoot(bool);     // radar namespace
settings_manager::saveWiFi(ssid, password);  // wifi namespace
settings_manager::loadWiFi(ssid, password);  // wifi namespace
settings_manager::prepareForOTAReboot();     // stamp=0 + clear boot flags
```

---

## Boot Mode Safety

After any firmware flash (USB upload or OTA), the device always boots to radar mode on the first boot, regardless of previous WiFi settings.

**Mechanism:**
- `scripts/gen_version.py` writes `FW_BUILD_TS` (Unix epoch timestamp) to `include/core/fw_version_gen.h` on every build
- `FW_STAMP_VAL = FW_BUILD_TS` — unique per build
- On boot, `loadSettings()` compares stored `fw_stamp` to `FW_STAMP_VAL`. A mismatch clears `wifi_ap_en` and `wifi_sta_en` and writes the new stamp
- Any new build produces a new timestamp → stamp mismatch → radar mode

**OTA extra guarantee:**
- `prepareForOTAReboot()` writes `fw_stamp=0` to NVS before restart
- `FW_BUILD_TS` is always a real Unix timestamp (> 1 billion) — `0` never matches
- Belt-and-suspenders: even if the build timestamp somehow matches a stored value, the explicit `0` write guarantees a mismatch

## Security Model

**Current state:**
- State-changing endpoints — `POST /update` (firmware flash), `POST /upload`, `DELETE /delete/*`,
  `POST /reload` — and the `/logs*` routes require HTTP Basic Auth, checked against the AP password
  (`check_admin_auth()` / `require_admin_auth()` in `gpx_server.cpp`). Read-only browsing (`/`,
  `/list`, `/waypoints`, `/storage`, GPX downloads) does not, so viewing already-loaded caches
  doesn't repeatedly prompt for a password.
- In AP mode, the WPA2 password (`radar123`) is the only barrier — anyone who knows it can reach the web server
- In STA mode, the device joins an existing network where the owner doesn't control who else is on
  it; the same HTTP Basic Auth check is what stops other devices on that network from reaching the
  admin endpoints, since WPA2 association is no longer a meaningful gate there.
- HTTP Basic Auth is sent base64-encoded, not encrypted — there is no TLS. It stops opportunistic and
  off-path access; it does not stop an on-path passive sniffer on the same WiFi segment (trivial on
  an open/WEP-class attacker position, harder on WPA2/3 but not impossible). Treat it as raising the
  bar, not as a substitute for a trusted network.
- Firmware images accepted by `/update` are still unsigned — Secure Boot / `SECURE_SIGNED_APPS` are
  not enabled (see `sdkconfig.db-radar`). The auth check above gates *who* may submit an image; it
  does not add cryptographic integrity to the image itself. Enabling Secure Boot v2 / Flash Encryption
  would close that gap, but burns eFuses irreversibly and needs its own key-management process — out
  of scope for this pass, left as a deliberate follow-up.
- WiFi is opt-in: the device boots to radar mode (no network) by default.

**For open source use:**
- The AP password now defaults to a value derived per-device from the factory MAC
  (`deriveDefaultAPPassword()` in `settings_manager.cpp`) instead of one fixed string shared by every
  unit — publishing the source no longer hands out every device's default AP password. A user who
  already saved a custom password in NVS keeps it unchanged.
- AP SSID and password are NVS-configurable from Settings → WiFi (`saveAPSSID()` / `saveAPPassword()`
  in `settings_manager.cpp`), not hardcoded.

**Threat model:**
- Device is not always-on — WiFi only activates when the user explicitly enables it.
- OTA requires either WiFi range of the AP, or presence on the STA network the device has joined,
  plus the admin credential.
- The primary remaining threats are: (1) an attacker who obtains the AP/admin password (by sniffing
  an unencrypted HTTP Basic Auth exchange, social engineering, or physical access to the Settings
  screen) can still submit an unsigned firmware image; (2) STA-mode LAN neighbors without the
  password are blocked from the admin endpoints but can still see that the device exists and probe
  the read-only routes.
